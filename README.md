Infos about the project.

The goal is a new development of the Minecraft server according to new standards and their implementation which should go in the direction of microservices.

Infos about microservices:

- [Microservices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices)
- [Microservices DE](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices)

Unfortunatly, the Minecraft server is not a microservice. It is a monolithic application. Exactly the same as the minecraft client.
So, unfortunately, we have to deviate a bit from the concept of microservices, since not everything can be implemented with the Minecraft client.
